Syzygy Transformation Toolchain
===============================

The Syzygy project consists of a suite of tools for the instrumentation of
COFF object files and PE binaries. 
The various instrumentation modes allow for
computing code coverage results, profiling source code, applying profile-guided
basic block optimizations, block (function) level profile-guided reordering, and
finding memory errors.

>For detailed instructions on each of the tools refer to `syzygy/build/README.txt`
(also included in binary releases), or refer to the output of the tool itself
when run with `--help`.
