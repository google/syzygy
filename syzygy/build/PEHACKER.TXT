PE HACKER
=========

PE Hacker is a general purpose tool for manipulating Windows 32-bit PE files. It
is driven by a configuration file, which may in turn be specialized via the
command-line.


1. Configuration File Format
============================

A configuration file consists of a UTF-8 JSON-encoded text file. The format is
heavily inspired by the GYP format, used by the Chromium family of projects. The
top level consists of a dictionary. It is expected that this dictionary contain
a 'targets' entry, which itself must be a list of dictionaries. This list
contains a description of transformations to be applied to each target, with
the targets being processed in the order they are specified. At minimum, each
target specifies an input module, an output and a list of operations to be
applied:

{
  'targets': [
    # Module 1.
    {
      # Paths are relative to the current working directory by default.
      'input_module': 'foo.dll',
      'output_module': 'bar.dll',
      'operations': [
        ...
      ],
    },
    # Module 2.
    {
      ...
    },
    # Other modules...
    ...
  ]
}

Each operation is itself a dictionary describing the specific operation to be
applied to the input module. The operations will be applied sequentially in
their order of declaration. The format of this dictionary is specific to the
operation in question, but they all contain a 'type' entry naming the type of
operation to apply.

1.1 Defining Variables
----------------------

The top level dictionary of a configuration file may specify a dictionary of
named local variables that can be used in variable expansion through the rest of
the configuration file. These have the format:

{
  'variables': {
    'name': 'value',
  },
  ...
}

Variable names can not be repeated, and must be unique. Variable names must be
valid C-style variable names. By convention user-defined variables use the
naming style 'user_defined_variable'.

1.2 Built-in Variables
----------------------

There are a handful of built-in variables that are defined automatically at
runtime. By convention there use uppercase names like 'BUILT_IN_VARIABLE'. They
consist of:

  ROOT: The full path of the directory containing the root PEHacker
        configuration file that is being processed.

1.3 Default Variable Values
---------------------------

Variables may be specified via the command-line. However, it is sometimes useful
to specify default values for variables that have not been explicitly specified.
This can be done by suffixing the variable name with the '%' character in the
'variables' section.

1.4 Variable Expansion
----------------------

Variables are referenced via the standard shell mechanism: $(name).
Variables are expanded immediately as they are encountered during processing.


2. Operations
=============

Individual operations and their configuration file dictionary formats are
defined below.

2.1 Adding Imports
------------------

This operation injects imports into a PE file. It proceeds as follows:

  - Injects an import data directory if none exists.
  - Injects an import for the module if none exists.
  - Injects an import for the function if none exists.

Newly created entries will be added to the end of any existing lists. Imports
may be specified by name or as ordinals. The operation is configured as follows:

  {
    'type': 'add_imports',
    'modules': [
      {
        # Adds an import dependency on bar.dll, complaining if one already
        # exists.
        'module_name': 'bar.dll',
        'must_not_exist': True,

        'imports': [
          # Adds an import for bar.dll:FooBar, failing if one already exists.
          { 'function_name': 'FooBar', 'must_not_exist': True },

          # Adds an import for bar.dll:2, not failing if one already exists
          # ('must_not_exist' was not explicitly specified and defaults to
          # False.)
          { 'ordinal': 2 },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

2.2 Ordering Imports
--------------------

This operation explicitly orders imports. Any imported modules or functions
not explicitly specified will maintain their original relative ordering but be
pushed to the end of any explicitly named imports.

  {
    'type': 'order_imports',
    'modules': [
      # bar.dll will be the first imported module. Its imports will be left in
      # their original order.
      { 'module_name': 'bar.dll' },

      # foo.dll will be the second imported module.
      {
        'module_name': 'foo.dll',
        # Function 'FooBar' will be made the first import. Any other functions
        # will be left in their original orders.
        'imports': [
          { 'function_name': 'FooBar' }
        ],
      },

      # baz.dll will be left in its original relative position, but it's
      # imports will themselves be reordered.
      {
        'module_name': 'baz.dll',

        # The presence of this key indicates that the module entry itself is
        # not to be ordered, but its imports are. If not specified this
        # defaults to True.
        'order': False,

        'imports': [
          { 'function_name': 'baz1' },
          { 'function_name': 'baz2' }
        ],
      }
    ],
  }

2.3 Removing Unused Imports
---------------------------

This operation removes any imports that are not explicitly referenced by
anything in the PE file.

  {
    'type': 'removed_unused_imports',

    # If this is specified then modules containing no imports will be left in
    # the import table. If not specified this defaults to True, in which case
    # empty module imports will be removed.
    'remove_empty_modules': False
  }

2.4 Redirecting Imports
-----------------------

This operation hijacks an import entry and redirects all its referrers to
another import entry.

  {
    'type': 'redirect_imports',
    'redirects': [
      {
        # Redirects all uses of foo.dll:foo to bar.dll:3. Both imports must
        # exist at the time of this operation.
        'from': { 'module_name': 'foo.dll', 'function_name': 'foo' },
        'to': { 'module_name': 'bar.dll', 'ordinal': 3 },
      },
      {
        # Another redirect...
      },
      ...
    ],
  }
